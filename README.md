## :dart: About ##

Discuss is a Slack like app built with a vanilla javacript frontend, bootstrap for styling, and backend of node.js and express.js.

It has most of the functionality of slack, including but not limited to signing up and login, joining and creating private or public channels, inviting members to channels, pinning, reacting to, editing, and deleting messages, as well as sending image messages.

The motivation behind building the project was to understand how javascript really works before moving on to learning a framework like react.

The frontend of the project can be found at [Discuss Client](https://github.com/nicolunardi/Discuss-client)
